OVERVIEW of the project:

#Project: MOBILE APP WIREFRAMING

## Objective:
Create wireframes for a mobile app idea of your choice using design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. Define the app's navigation flow, screen layouts, and basic UI elements to convey the app's functionality and user interaction.

Based on the project the activities I performed:
1. **Wireframing and Mockups**:
   - The interface shows different frames representing wireframes or mockups for an app's screens. Wireframes are basic visual representations of layout and structure, while mockups provide a more detailed view of the UI elements.
   - Key Activity: Creating wireframes and mockups to define screen layouts and basic UI elements.
   - Technology: Design tools or software for wireframing and prototyping (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD).

2. **Navigation System**:
   - The vertical navigation bar on the left suggests that the designer is defining the app's navigation flow. Navigation elements like menus, tabs, and navigation 
     bars are crucial for guiding users through the app.
   - Key Activity: Designing the app's navigation system.
   - Technology: UI/UX design tools with navigation components.

3. **UI Elements and Components**:
   - The frames contain placeholders for text, images, buttons, and other UI components. These represent the basic building blocks of the app's user interface.
   - Key Activity: Defining UI elements (buttons, icons, text fields) and their placement.
   - Technology: Design tools with libraries of UI components.

4. **Prototyping and Interaction Design**:
   - The "Prototype" section in the navigation bar indicates that the designer is likely creating interactive prototypes. Prototypes allow testing of user 
     interactions and transitions between screens.
   - Key Activity: Creating interactive prototypes to convey user interaction.
   - Technology: Prototyping tools (e.g., InVision, Marvel, Principle).

5. **Collaboration and Handoff**:
   - The "Handoff" section suggests collaboration with developers. Designers can use this feature to share design specs, assets, and CSS code directly with the development team.
   - Key Activity: Collaborating with developers during the design-to-development handoff.
   - Technology: Collaboration tools integrated into design platforms.
  
When designing UI elements to convey app functionality and user interaction, I considered the following essential components:
1.Buttons
2.Text Fields
3.Icons
4.Navigation bars
5.Images and Illustrations
6.Feedback Elements
7.Typography
